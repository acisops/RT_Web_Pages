Change Description
==================

limitpager.pl is a Perl program which runs as a cron job on each of the 4
ACIS Ops Real Time monitoring computers. The instances of limitpager on
each of the 4 machines are identical.

When we are in Real Time Comm with Chandra, limitpager accesses the real
time data coming down from the spacecraft and checks several MSID's in
order to determine if those values are within the Caution and Warning limits.
If a caution limit is violated, alerts are sent to the ACIS Ops team via direct email and OpsGenie.
In the case of a warning limit violation, limitpager sends an email,
an SMS alert via vtext emails and OpsGenie.  ACIS Ops decided to remove the vtext emails since
they are less reliable and redundant.

Testing:
======== 

Tests for limitpager were carried out running the new version of the program
on aciscdp-v during comms to assure that the emails and texts were sent
correctly.  To generate a red alert, the aciscdp-v  limit file, used by limitpager, was
temporarily modified to adjust the 1PIN1AT limit to force a red alert.

All emails were received as expected - all tests passed.

Once the tests were completed the production limit file  and production limitpager.pl file
was restored.
