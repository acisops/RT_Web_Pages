Change Description
==================

limitpager.pl is a Perl program, run as a cron job, which runs on each of the 4
ACIS Ops Real Time monitoring computers. The instances of limitpager on
each of the 4 machines are identical.

When we are in Real Time Comm with Chandra, Limitpager accesses the real
time data coming down from the spacecraft and checks several MSID's in
order to determine if those values are within the Caution and Warning limits.

One ACIS MSID: 1PIN1AT has a faulty transducer and emits a value above
the Caution High limit. This is duly reported by limitpager in an
email.  This is a known fault, and is ignored by the ACIS team, but is
used as a "heartbeat" check of limitpager, the 4 machines limitpager
runs on,  the email system and the network.

The update to limitpager in this PR consisted of adding Jim Francis to the alert list.

acis-P3-fluence.pl is run as a cron job and periodically calculates the attenuated
fluence for the present orbit. If the fluence exceeds 1.0e+09, an email is sent
out to ACIS Operations, and the message  contains the flux and fluence values.
For this update,  Jim Francis was added to the email list. In addition utilization
of the OpsGenie  system was added to the email alerts.

Testing:
======== 

Unit and functional tests for limitpager were carried out running a version during
comms to assure that the emails and texts get through.  The 1PIN1AT "heartbeat"
emails arrived every comm from both OpsGenie and the email systems
and contain the URL for that machine's R/T web page.
Unit tests were carried out to ensure the R/T web page URL displayed is
the correct one for each R/T computer.

Unit and functional tests for acis-P3-fluence were carried out by running a version
of the new code with a very low fluence limit (1.0) to assure that emails are sent out.

All emails were received as expected.

All tests passed.
