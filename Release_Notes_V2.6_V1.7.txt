Change Description
==================

limitpager.pl is a Perl program, run as a cron job, which runs on each of the 4
ACIS Ops Real Time monitoring computers. The instances of limitpager on
each of the 4 machines are identical.

When we are in Real Time Comm with Chandra, Limitpager accesses the real
time data coming down from the spacecraft and checks several MSID's in
order to determine if those values are within the Caution and Warning limits.

One ACIS MSID: 1PIN1AT has a faulty transducer and emits a value above
the Caution High limit. This is duly reported by limitpager in an
email.  This is a known fault, and is ignored by the ACIS team, but is
used as a "heartbeat" check of limitpager, the 4 machines limitpager
runs on,  the email system and the network.

The update to limitpager in this PR consisted of adding Jim Francis to the alert list.

acis-P3-fluence.pl is run as a cron job and periodically calculates the attenuated
fluence for the present orbit. If the fluence exceeds 1.0e+09, an email is sent
out to ACIS Operations, and the message  contains the flux and fluence values.
For this update,  Jim Francis was added to the email list. There are two email
alerts sent out - one for exceeding 1.0e+09 for the orbit and one for when a clearly
bogus flux value is reported by ACE.  Also, utilization of the OpsGenie  system was
added to the email alerts. In addition, a -t switch was added to the command line
so that test values would be used for flux values rather than the production values.
This allows testing of the email systems.

Testing:
======== 

Tests for limitpager were carried out running the new version of the program
from the command line and during comms to assure that the emails and texts were sent
correctly.  The program was also run as a cron job.  The 1PIN1AT "heartbeat" emails
arrived every comm from both OpsGenie and the email systems. 

Tests for acis-P3-fluence were carried out by running a version of the new code, from
the command line,  with and without the -t switch, and as an ongoing cron job, in production mode.   

All emails were received as expected for both programs.

All tests passed.

There is no real opportunity for sub module unit testing: the programs were tested as a whole to
determine if the -t switch worked correctly and that every email recipient received their emails.
