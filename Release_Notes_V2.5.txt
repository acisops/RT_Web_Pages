Change Description
==================

limitpager is a Perl program which runs on each of the 4 ACIS Ops Real
Time monitoring computers. The instances of limitpager on each of the
4 machines are identical.

When we are in Real Time Comm with Chandra, Limitpager accesses the real
time data coming down from the spacecraft and checks several MSID's in
order to determine if those values are within the Caution and Warning limits.

One ACIS MSID: 1PIN1AT has a faulty transducer and emits a value above
the Caution High limit. This is duly reported by limitpager in an
email.  This is a known fault, and is ignored by the ACIS team, but is
used as a "heartbeat" check of limitpager, the 4 machines limitpager
runs on,  and the network.

The updates included in this PR include some modification of the
variables containing recipient email addresses and text phone numbers.
Utilization of the OpsGenie alert system was added to the alerts.
The former text alert system using mailx  was retained, however it was modified to
send the texts out in a loop with a delay between the texts to prevent
"throttling" by the Verizon service. So the ACIS Teams receive text
alerts of a Warning limit violation from redundant sources.  limitpager.pl
was updated to include the R/T web page URL specific to the machine
that limitpager is running on.

Testing:
======== 

Unit and functional tests were carried out running a version during comms to
assure that the emails and texts get through.  The 1PIN1AT "heartbeat"
emails arrived every comm from both OpsGenie and the email systems
and contain the URL for that machine's R/T web page..
Unit tests were carried out to ensure the R/T web page URL displayed is
the correct one for each R/T computer.

All tests passed.
