Change Description
==================

limitpager is a Perl program which runs on each of the 4 ACIS Ops Real
Time monitoring computers. The instances of limitpager on each of the
4 machines are identical.

When we are in Real Time Comm with Chandra, Limitpager accesses the real
time data coming down from the spacecraft and checks several MSID's in
order to determine if those values are within the Caution and Warning limits.
If a Caution limit is violated, limitpager sends emails to the ACIS
team. If a Warning limit is violated, limitpager sends both emails and
text messages to the ACIS Team.

One ACIS MSID: 1PIN1AT has a faulty transducer and emits a value above
the Caution High limit. This is duly reported by limitpager in an
email.  This is a known fault, and is ignored by the ACIS team, but is
used as a "heartbeat" check of limitpager, the 4 machines limitpager
runs on,  and the network.

The updates included in this PR include some modification of the email
addresses and text phone numbers.  Utilization of the OpsGenie alert
system was added to the alerts.  The former text alert system was retained,
however it was modified to send the texts out in a loop with a delay
between the texts to prevent "throttling" by the Verizon service. So
the ACIS Teams receive text alerts of a Warning limit violation from
redundant sources.

Testing:
======== 

Program tests were carried out running a version during comms to
assure that the emails and texts get through.  The 1PIN1AT "heartbeat"
emails arrived every comm from both OpsGenie and the email systems.
The Red alert emails and texts arrived during the OCT3122 1DPAMZT red alert.


All tests passed.
